# LINKAM95_V4

A PVAccess enabled version of the IBEX IOC which is set to run in simulation mode

There are two "main" branches:

master - which should work anywhere once the RELEASE file has been adjusted (unconfirmed)
ibex_version - drop the code into the ioc\master folder of IBEX and build it and it should work. It has to be built separately as IBEX's build will ignore it
